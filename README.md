# Strong-firewall
Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to configuring a strong firewall for your Linux OS PC using iptables, which is a popular firewall management tool:
Step 1: Check if iptables is installed 
Open a terminal and enter the following command to check if iptables is installed on your system:
"sudo iptables -V"
If it is not installed, you can install it using the appropriate package manager for your Linux distribution.
Step 2: Set default policies
By default, we will set the firewall to deny all incoming and outgoing traffic. However, we will allow established connections to continue functioning. Run the following commands:
"sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP"
"sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP"
"sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP"
Step 3: Allow loopback interface
The loopback interface allows communication within the local machine. Run the following command:
"sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT"
"sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT"
